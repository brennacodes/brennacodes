I'm new to programming. My background in the arts and experience working as a product manager in consumer goods gives me a unique perspective when approaching software projects - I am always on the hunt for an approach that is efficient and effective to create things that are intuitive and enjoyable to use. I never tire of learning, creating, organizing, or uncovering and implementing efficiencies. I currently live in Boulder, Colorado with my furry companion, Leeloo (that's her in the picture with me!).

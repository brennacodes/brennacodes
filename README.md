# Hello! <img width="35" src="https://github.com/1999AZZAR/1999AZZAR/blob/main/resources/img/waving.gif">

### **Welcome**

**My name is Brenna**. I'm new to programming. My background in the arts and experience working as a product manager in consumer goods gives me a unique perspective when approaching software projects - I am always on the hunt for an approach that is efficient and effective to create things that are intuitive and enjoyable to use. I never tire of learning, creating, organizing, or uncovering and implementing efficiencies. I currently live in Boulder, Colorado with my furry companion, Leeloo (that's her in the picture with me!). Right now, I am learning Ruby (*Rails coming soon!*), testing with RSpec & Minitest, debugging with Pry and irb, and playing around with the usual suspects on the side - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Some things I look forward to learning more about in the future are:
- web3 technologies, 
- working with open source AI tools (for natural language processing, LIDAR applications of AI, image recognition),
- functional programming languages ([such as Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/))
- working with realtime databases (like [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore))

## **What am I doing?**

I'm new to programming. My experience working as a product manager and background in the arts give me a unique perspective when approaching software development - I am always on the hunt for processes that are efficient in order to create applications and experiences that are intuitive, enjoyable, and solve actual problems. My world lights up when I witness ideas becoming reality, and I love working with diverse teams to make that happen. Learning, creating, organizing, and uncovering and implementing efficiencies are things I never tire of. I currently live in Boulder, Colorado with my furry companion, Leeloo (that's her in the picture with me!).
